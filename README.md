# Life - Secure Offline Data Vault

This is a native Android application built with Kotlin for securely storing personal data offline.

## Features

*   **Secure Login:** The app is protected by a master password.
*   **Encrypted Database:** All data is stored in a local database encrypted with SQLCipher, using your master password as the key.
*   **Data Management:** Securely store information for your Banks, Cards, Policies, and Aadhar.
*   **Backup & Restore:** Create password-protected, AES-256 encrypted backups of your data and restore them when needed.
*   **Modern UI:** The app uses Material 3 theming with support for both light and dark modes.

## How to Build and Run

This project is a standard Android Gradle project.

1.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio (latest stable version recommended).
    *   Select "Open" and navigate to the root directory of this project.

2.  **Gradle Sync:**
    *   Android Studio will automatically detect the Gradle files (`build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`) and start a "Gradle Sync" process. This will download all the required dependencies.
    *   This may take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection.

3.  **Run the App:**
    *   Once the Gradle Sync is complete, you can run the application.
    *   Select the `app` run configuration from the dropdown at the top of the screen.
    *   Choose an emulator or connect a physical Android device.
    *   Click the "Run" button (the green play icon).

## Important Note

This project does not contain the Gradle Wrapper files (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`). These files are typically generated by Android Studio or the `gradle wrapper` command. When you open this project in Android Studio, it should prompt you to set up the Gradle Wrapper if it's missing. If not, you can generate it by running `gradle wrapper` in the project's root directory from a terminal (requires a local Gradle installation).
